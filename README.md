# RSMap
A rebuild of osrs map into a nice google map like format, hoping to get the power of the ingame map on to the web. I know some already exist but they lack the features I'm trying to add
## Contributing to the project
Clone the repo, ensure you gatsby client setup (`npm install -g gatsby`)  
Run `npm i` in the project root  
Run `npm run develop` the site will then be hosted locally at localhost:8000
Run `npm run build` to set up a production build, ideally this wouldn't be in the repo but im commiting it so i can have dumb servers that don't need to build the project and can just git pull
