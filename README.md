# RSMap

See the site live here: [rsmap.uk](https://rsmap.uk/)

## About
Built on gatsby and react. The aim was a rebuilt of osrs map into a nice map like format, hoping to get the power of the ingame map on to the web. I know some already exist but they lack the features I'm trying to add

## Contributing to the project
Clone the repo, ensure you gatsby client setup (`npm install -g gatsby`)  
Run `npm i` in the project root  
Run `npm run develop` the site will then be hosted locally at localhost:8000
Run `npm run build` to set up a production build, ideally this wouldn't be in the repo but im commiting it so i can have dumb servers that don't need to build the project and can just git pull


#### Issues to fix before going live
- Double check troll stronghold shortcuts
- Double check Arandar Shorcuts
#### Goal features
- Monster Locator (Searching for a monster would show you locations)
- Convert coord clues to map coordinates (Needed but difficult to do)
- Region highlighting (Area locked ironmen, multi combat)
- Farm patch info (Not sure anyone would ever use this)
- Mining spot info (Not sure anyone would ever use this)
- Stores to show what they sell w/ quantities (Not sure anyone would ever use this)
- Clue scroll locations (Not sure anyone would ever use this)
- Show quickest route through dungeons
- Allow Drawing on the map (Could be cool, especially if we can share 'sessions' so you and friends can draw routes on the map)
- Remember position on refresh (inside dungeons)
- Add Ogre caves (Jiggig, Gutanoth)
