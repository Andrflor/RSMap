# RSMap
A rebuild of osrs map into a nice google map like format, hoping to get the power of the ingame map on to the web. I know some already exist but they lack the features I'm trying to add
## Contributing to the project
Clone the repo, ensure you gatsby client setup (`npm install -g gatsby`)  
Run `npm i` in the project root  
Run `npm run develop` the site will then be hosted locally at localhost:8000
Run `npm run build` to set up a production build, ideally this wouldn't be in the repo but im commiting it so i can have dumb servers that don't need to build the project and can just git pull

## About
Built on gatsby and react  
Planned features (To do before even releasing):
- ~All teleport locations~
- ~Click on boat locations to see where they go~
- ~Location searcher~
- ~Agility short cuts to show where they go and level needed~
